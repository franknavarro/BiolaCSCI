A manual test to run to find out if the website is compatible with multiple
browsers.

Description: I copied and pasted our jenkins server IP into multiple browsers.
This brought up the login screen. I logged on using the default email:
mark.a.gong-guy@biola.edu and password: password. If the login worked and the
html was formatted as it should be then I marked the test successful. Note:
More will be added to this test as more functionality opens up on the website.
