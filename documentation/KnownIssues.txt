Known Issues

Description: The following are known issues with our website that we are still
trying to fix. Most of them we haven't had time to get to while others are of
a minor nature and aren't worth our time.

1. Database connectivity. We have a database and a server but the website on the
server is not connecting to the database. We should be able to fix this, We just
need the people who have worked on the database together in the same room.

2. Integration of the front end and the back end. One our members has been
working on the front end and is almost to the point of connecting the front end
to the back end but ran out of time in this iteration.

3. Trying to figure out how we are going to generate the users for the
website. Whether through forms or manually inserting them into the database.

4. The css in the Internet Explorer browser is not working.

5. There is a clicking error on the class page if you click in between the two
drop down menus it loses functionality.
