Description: Below is an installation script for downloading and setting up our
website with a server and database. After that it shows you the website in it's
current state and a few tests. The script places a server and database on the
user's computer that can be run off of the host machines IP.

Prior to running our installation script please make sure the below requirements
are met.

System Requirements:
    -CentOS 7 x86

Deployment Plan

1. Download tar file and place it on your Desktop.

2. Open up a terminal and enter the command: cd Desktop/

3. Unzip tar file with the command: tar -xvf MidIterationBuild.tar

4. Navigate into the website file using the the command: cd MidIterationBuild/

5. Change permissions on the installer.sh file with the command: chmod 755 installer.sh

6. Run the installer.sh script with the command ./installer.sh

7. Follow the below prompts to instructions to navigate through the database
setup.
    a. Set the root password? [Y/n] - Hit Y and set the root password to "root"
    b. Remove Anonymous users? [Y/n] - Hit Y
    c. Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] - Default we would recommend that
    you use Y however if you would like to access the database remotely then
    enable this option
    d. Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] - Hit Y
    e. Reload Privilege tables now? [Y/n] - Hit Y
    f. When prompted enter the root password that you set above
    (Your input will not display just hit enter after you type your password)

8. Start up a web browser and type (HostIP) into the browser. (It should bring
up a login page.)

You have successfully installed the CSCI website please use the following information

Accessing

    Website
        1. Point your browser to (ip of host machine)

        3. (This is not typical on most systems)
        When  logging in if you encounter "cannot connect to database error"
        selinux is preventing the web server from contacting the database. To
        get around this use the following command in your terminal to disable
        selinux on the web server.  setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect=1

    Tests and Debug Material
    (Located at /var/www/html/tests/)
        - Usability Tests
            -Each of these are a text file that you can run manually to see if
            they work. Results are included with a timestamp.
        - PHP Class Test
            Note: User Add Function will only run one time because it adds a
            user to the db and if you refresh
            it tries to add it again but will fail as the user already exists.
            - To run tests point your browser to (hostip)/runtests.php, results
            should appear on screen
        (More Coming Soon)
